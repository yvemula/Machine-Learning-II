# Machine-Learning-II

a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time series prediction with TensorFlow and Keras in Python. 
This model can be applied to various real-world problems such as stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and more.

# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of RNN, using TensorFlow and Keras:

This code demonstrates a more advanced AI model using LSTM for time series prediction. You can apply this to various real-world scenarios by replacing the sample dataset with your own time series data.
